						<h2>"A Walk Around The World" - By Jake Cioffi</h2>
						<p class="lead">Welcome! Here you may find a collection of my work. This website was created using bootstrap, java, and some css. It may act as a virtual portfolio to showcase the work I have created throughout my time studying graphic design. Have a look around at some of my work. Below you can find some of my top favorite musical artists, along with some album artwork that was created in homage to them.</p>

				<h3>Dave Matthews</h3>
				<p>My family has been obsessed with Dave for years. I have been to a handful of shows, however nothing comparable to the amount my parents have. I believe it was the one time the two of them saw Dave and had the privilege of going backstage where Carter Beaufort would toss his drum sticks to my mother to catch that they would become actually obssessed with them. Since they have long admired Dave and his band, they rubbed off on my brother and I fairly well. Going to JMU, I was completely unaware of the fact that I was now only an hour away from the stomping grounds of the man himself. It wasn't until I began to see all the firedancers everywhere that I felt so at home.</p>

				<h3>Mac Miller</h3>
				<p>I grew up listening to hip-hop for as long as I can remember. Early on I jumped around listening to multiple different people or whatever was on, but that all changed in the fifth grade. When my older brother Jon gave me his iPod touch one summer to listen to, he shared with me then what would become my favorite artist to date, let alone to ever live. Over the years of listening to Mac, I use to sketch pictures of him and even mockup album covers I would create for fun at times. I created this poster of album covers in commemoration of him prior to his last posthumous release titled "Circles". Long live the king, 92 till infinity, MOST DOPE.</p>
			</div><!-- end section 2 -->
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h3>Kanye West</h3>
				<p>Kanye, though he is Kanye, has been one of my favorite artists for some time now. Flashing back, I can vividly reminisce on the first time I ever heard the chorus of "Flashing Lights". It was as if some divine revelation had occurred in me then, because all I can recall from that day was going home and listening to the song 100,000 times on repeat. This would soon become a habitual thing with his music. The picture below was created by both myself and a friend. The inspiration came from sitting around and waiting hoping for another album of his to drop, and it was completed after his last album "Jesus Is King" released.</p>

					<h2>Note:</h2>
					<p>Music has always held a special place in my life, yet only a few individual artists have truly stuck with me and touched me. Kanye West and Mac Miller will forever hold the throne as being my top hip hop artists, yet the Gru Grux King lives on over everyone and everything no matter what.</p>
